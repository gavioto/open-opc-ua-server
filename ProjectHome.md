# New Project Name: opcua4j #

This project was renamed -- Java fans will love it -- to **opcua4j**. Its new project home is at http://code.google.com/p/opcua4j/. Our project helps to implement an OPC UA server in Java by hiding a lot of OPC UA stuff a developer should not burdened with.

We renamed our project because there exists another open source implementation of OPC UA in C/C++ from the `OpenOpcUa` initiative founded in 2009 and led by Michel Condemine. Have a look at their work at http://www.openopcua.org/.
