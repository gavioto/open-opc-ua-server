#summary Annotation based Node mappings

= Introduction =

Mapping domain specific data to OPC UA nodes is repetitive and failure prone. For example to create the correct OPC UA nodes out of a complex Java bean you have to deal with OPC UA references to design the bean-in-bean relationships.

== Example ==
Consider we want to create OPC UA nodes of the following bean:

{{{
public class Student{
  private String name;
  private Date birthday;
  private University uni;

  ...
}
}}}
