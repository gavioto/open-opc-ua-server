#summary Documentation of all annotations and how to use them

= Overview =

Annotations are probably the easiest way to publish data into the OPC UA address space. To use annotations 2 things have to be done:
 * Annotate the beans as desired
 * Use an instance of `AnnotationNodeManager` with an custom implementation of the IAnnotationSource interface 

= Wiring everything up =

{{{
UAServer s = new UAServer();
...

AnnotationNodeManager annoNMgr = 
   new AnnotationNodeManager(
      new SampleNodeManager(),
      "my building",
      "contains some sample nodes of a building",
      "sampleBuilding"
   );

//add nodes to get introspected at startup -> this is a good practice
annoNMgr.addObjectToIntrospect(new Floor());
annoNMgr.addObjectToIntrospect(new Room());
s.addNodeManager(annoNMgr);
